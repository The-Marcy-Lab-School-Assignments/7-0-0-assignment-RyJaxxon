# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer
Our setter function is actually a callback function that is executed once useState is invoked. So when the setter function is returned, this helper function is executed and the state is changed.

Yup! And what happens to the component where the state is being used in?
